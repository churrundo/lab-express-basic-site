    <h1>About Thomas Sankara</h1>

    <p>
      Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara (21 December 1949 - 15 October 1987) was a
      Burkinabé military officer, Marxist revolutionary, and Pan-Africanist. He
      served as the President of Burkina Faso from 1983 to his assassination in
      1987. Sankara was seen by his supporters as a charismatic and iconic
      figure of revolution【9†source】.

      After being appointed Prime Minister in 1983, Sankara was eventually
      imprisoned due to disputes with the sitting government. While under house
      arrest, a group of revolutionaries seized power on his behalf in a
      popularly-supported coup. At the age of 33, Sankara became the President
      of the Republic of Upper Volta. He initiated social, ecological, and
      economic programs and renamed the country from Upper Volta to Burkina
      Faso, which translates to 'Land of Incorruptible People'. The people of
      the nation are known as Burkinabé, meaning 'upright people'【10†source】.

      Sankara's foreign policies were centered on anti-imperialism. He rejected
      aid from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and instead
      welcomed aid from other sources. He aimed to reduce reliance on aid by
      boosting domestic revenues and diversifying the sources of
      assistance【11†source】.

      His domestic policies encompassed famine prevention, agrarian
      self-sufficiency, land reform, and the suspension of rural poll taxes.
      Sankara focused on a nationwide literacy campaign and a vaccination
      program against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles. His government also
      concentrated on building schools, health centers, water reservoirs, and
      infrastructure projects. He combated the desertification of the Sahel by
      planting over 10 million trees【12†source】.

      Moreover, he outlawed female genital mutilation, forced marriages, and
      polygamy. Sankara set up Cuban-inspired Committees for the Defense of the
      Revolution. He established Popular Revolutionary Tribunals to prosecute
      public officials charged with political crimes and corruption, considering
      such elements of the state as counter-revolutionaries【13†source】.

      Sankara’s revolutionary programs for African self-reliance made him an
      icon to many of Africa's poor. Sankara remained popular with a
      considerable majority of his country's citizens. However, some of his
      policies alienated elements of the former ruling class, including tribal
      leaders, and the governments of France and its ally, the Ivory Coast. On
      15 October 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise
      Compaoré, who assumed leadership of the state shortly thereafter and
      retained it until the 2014 Burkina Faso uprising【14†source】.
